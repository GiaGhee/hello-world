# hello-world
This is my first repository,  git ready, git set, CODE!!!!
I am a Independent Graphic Designer, Web Developer and Apparel Creator. I identify with human, for now. I enjoy carbs, I love being in the rain, but not if I'm wearing jeans, I'm shy but approachable. I still watch cartoon network. I'm looking forward to being a great information technology professional and *fingers crossed* landing a job as a Back-End Developer.
